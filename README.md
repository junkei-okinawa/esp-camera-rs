# esp-camera-rs
Rust wrapper library to interface with the ESP32 and ESP32 S3 cameras. The way to define configuration
for camera was reworked, get methods added and set methods rewrote to use macro.

See [examples/camera-example/README.md](examples/camera-example/README.md) for usage details.

Do not runt cargo build in this directory, run it in the example dir!
